            <br>
            California Golden trout are likely to become extinct in the wild in the next 50 years.
            While the Golden Trout Creek (GTC) population is relatively secure, the South Fork Kern
            River (SFKR) population is threatened by hybridization with hatchery-origin Coastal Rainbow
            trout, and predation and competition from introduced Brown trout.

        <p class="caption"><b>Coastal Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)</b>
            <br>
            Coastal Rainbow trout are the least vulnerable native trout species in California due
            to their high tolerance to a wide variety of environmental conditions, multiple life
            histories, and a large natural and expanded range (through introductions).

            <br>
            While recent progress has been made to improve access to spawning habitat in Pine Creek,
            Eagle Lake Rainbow trout (ELRT) do not exist as a self-sustaining wild population because
            of its dependence on hatchery propagation.

            <br>
            Goose Lake Redband trout do not face immediate risk of extinction. However, California populations
            are not secure because they are mostly small, largely isolated, and, during drought periods, the
            lake population disappears and stream populations contract.

        <p class="caption"><b>Kern River Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss gilbertii)</b>
            <br>
            Kern River Rainbow trout have a high probability of disappearing as a distinct entity in the next
            50 years, if not sooner. The greatest threat is hybridization with Coastal Rainbow trout, but
            competition and predation from invasive Brown and Brook trout may also be contributing to its decline.

            The Little Kern Golden trout is vulnerable to extinction in its native range in the next 100 years.
            The recovery of Little Kern Golden trout is ongoing, and the focus on reducing hybridized populations
            is shifting to improving genetic diversity, population connectivity and size, and expanding the speciesâ€™
            distribution.

            <br>
            McCloud River Redband trout populations are very small, fragmented, and exist in limited and isolated
            habitat. Their status could change rapidly, particularly in relation to predicted climate change impacts
            such as reduced snowpack and precipitation increasingly falling as rain instead of snow.
