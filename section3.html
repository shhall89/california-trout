            Coastal Cutthroat trout populations in California are small, fragmented, and face multiple
            threats, including cumulative impacts from land use practices. While their numbers appear
            to be stable in the few watersheds they inhabit it is equally likely that they have declined
            in response to watershed alteration throughout their range.

            <br>
            Despite significant efforts in recent years, wild, self-sustaining Lahontan Cutthroat trout in
            California face a large and increasing risk of extinction over the next 50 years due primarily
            to the presence of non-native trout and degraded habitats throughout their range.

        <p class="caption"><b>Paiute Cutthroat Trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii seleniris)</b>
            <br>
            Paiute Cutthroat trout have a high likelihood of extirpation in their native range within 50-100
            years without continued commitment to intense monitoring and management. All populations are small
            and isolated, and are susceptible to hybridization and local environmental changes.
