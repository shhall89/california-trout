        <h2>About Trout</h2>
        <p class="body">
            Trout are incredibly important for both aquatic ecosystems and human communities.
            As a keystone species, trout play a critical role in maintaining the balance and health of freshwater
            ecosystems.
            They are apex predators, feeding on smaller fish, insects, and other aquatic organisms.
            By regulating the populations of their prey, trout help to prevent overpopulation and maintain biodiversity.
            They also contribute to nutrient cycling by consuming and excreting organic matter, which helps to enrich
            the ecosystem and support the growth of aquatic vegetation.
            Additionally, trout serve as a food source for larger predators, such as birds and mammals, further
            contributing to the intricate web of life in freshwater habitats.
            <br>
            <br>
            Trout are highly valued by humans, both ecologically and economically.
            They are popular game fish and attract anglers from around the world.
            This recreational fishing activity provides economic benefits to local communities, supporting businesses
            such as fishing outfitters, guides, and tourism industries.
            The conservation and management of trout populations are crucial to ensure sustainable fishing practices and
            the long-term viability of these economic activities.
            Trout also serve as indicators of water quality.
            They are sensitive to pollution and changes in their habitat, making them valuable sentinels for
            environmental health.
            Monitoring trout populations can help detect and address issues such as water pollution, habitat
            degradation, and climate change impacts, leading to better management practices and the preservation of
            healthy aquatic ecosystems for future generations.

        <h4>Trout in California</h4>
        <p class="body">
            California is renowned for its diverse and productive trout fisheries, offering a range of angling
            opportunities for fishing enthusiasts.
            From pristine mountain streams to large reservoirs and alpine lakes, California's trout fisheries are as
            varied as its stunning landscapes.
            <br>
            <br>
            To ensure the sustainability of these fisheries, California's Department of Fish and Wildlife implements
            regulations and management strategies.
            These measures include bag limits, size restrictions, and seasonal closures to protect spawning periods and
            maintain healthy populations.
            Conservation efforts, such as habitat restoration, stream enhancement projects, and hatchery programs, are
            also in place to support the long-term viability of trout populations.
